            <p className="pt-2"> Hi! I’m Samantha, a frontend developer with a background in business and project management. I enjoy bringing ideas to life through clean, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces.
After completing a BSc in Resource Enterprise and Entrepreneurship, I discovered a passion for tech and began learning frontend development. I’ve worked with tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to build functional web pages.
I recently took time to strengthen my skills in project management and virtual assistance, which improved how I work with teams, manage timelines, and communicate effectively. Now, I am currently looking for opportunities to sharpen my skills further.
When I’m not coding, you’ll find me organizing digital projects, improving user journeys, or learning new ways to combine tech with real-world solutions.
Let’s build something amazing together!.Feel free to contact me for opportunities and collaborations.</p>
